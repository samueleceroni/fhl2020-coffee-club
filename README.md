MS Coffee Club is an internal MS tool which allows employees to get to know each other semi-randomly, to support diversity and inclusion while trying to meet your preferences at the same time.

Some of the aim of the club:

* exchange ideas, thoughts, tips about how to live your best life in Microsoft
* know more parts of the company and understand each other points of view
* foster the exchange of ideas which may lead to the creation of new projects
* have a coffee altogether!
